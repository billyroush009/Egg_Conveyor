UI / Display:
- web page (html/css)
-- bootstrap for design
- (2-3) pages, configuration / run page, display results page, log page(?)


Processing / Result:
- python or javascript
- read user settings
-- save to .csv, "get" http request(?)
-- parse into usable data structure (dictionary?)
- read csv
-- parse info into usable variables / sets (to start)
-- parse info into a way that represents one "scan"
-"adjust the speed of the conveyor to try and maintain a desired rate of eggs"
--



General Questions:
-Include error checking or assume ideal conditions?
-What is the "per-scan rate achieved for each scan"?
-What is the "user adjustable average across multiple scans"?
-What is "final throughput for the entire run" measured in/as?
--how many eggs were processed
-Can we cap the process/controller to never run above "maximum allowable rate"?
-What is limiting how many eggs we can send?
