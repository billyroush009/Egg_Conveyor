Egg Flow Program Plan:

-Important Terms / Variables:

Terms:
-Case: 360 eggs
-CPH: Cases per hour
-Maximum Conveyor Speed (100%): 100 inches per minute
-Minimum Conveyer Speed (1%): 10 inches per min

Variables:
-Starting Belt Speed
--"Current" Belt Speed
-Distance Traveled (inches) since last scan
-"Current" eggs on belt
-"Current" rate
-Run duration
-"Target" metrics for performance graph (to compare)
-Set of user designated settings (below)
-Average "rate"
-

UI / Display:
- User Entry Area(s):
-- target rate of eggs, expressed in "egg cases per hour"
-- maximum allowable rate for eggs, "egg cases per hour"
-- starting belt speed for the simulation
-- desired time period (seconds OR scans) for the average achieved output
-- the file to be used to supply the test info
--- any inputs for tuning the implemented control algorithm

Results:
- average rate achieved for the entire length of the conveyor
- performance graph:
-- "per-scan" rate achieved for each scan (??)
-- "user adjustable" average across multiple scans (??)
-- target CPH
-- anything else that guage / tune performance
- "real-world" simulation time taken to empty the conveyor
- amount of time the rate achieved was above the maximum allowable rate(?)
- final throughput for the entire run (cph?)
